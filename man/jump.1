.SH "NAME"
\fBjump\fR \- a quick and fuzzy directory jumper
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBj <term>\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBJump\fR lets you jump quickly across directories on you filesystem\.
.
.P
Jump works its magic by keeping track of the directories you visit\. It scores them to give the best match for the input term\. The term is fuzzily matched\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
\fBj\fR is a convenience short\-hand for jump\. To get that function and automatic directory scoring, jump has to be integrated with the current shell\.
.
.P
Run \fBjump shell\fR for shell integration instructions\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBRegular Jump\fR
.
.P
The default search behavior of \fBjump\fR is to match case insensitively only the base path (only the last directory name of the full absolute path) of the scored directories\.
.
.P
This is because absolute directory paths are long and short terms can fuzzy match them easily, which can lead to bad matches\. One of the goals of \fBjump\fR is to type less\. This assumption helps with that\.
.
.P
\fBCase Sensitive Jump\fR
.
.P
To trigger a case\-sensitive search, use a term that has different casing, at least in one of the letters\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ j Dev
$ pwd
/Users/foo/Development
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Even if there is \fB/Users/foo/Development/dev\-tools\fR that scores better\.
.
.P
\fBDeeper Directory Jump\fR
.
.P
Jump normalized all search terms to the base names of the scored directories, because absolute paths are long and short terms can fuzzy match them easily\.
.
.P
Given the following filesystem structure:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

/Users/foo/Development/society/
|\-\- artwork
|\-\- interview
+\-\- website

/Users/foo/Development/chaos/
+\-\- website
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
To ensure a match of \fB/Users/foo/Development/chaos/website\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ j ch/web
$ pwd
/Users/foo/Development/chaos/website
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The search is normalized only on the last two parts of the target paths\. This will ensure a better match, because the shorter path to fuzzy match on\.
.
.P
There can be many separators in the term\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ j dev/ch/web
$ pwd
/Users/foo/Development/chaos/website
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The term above will match the last three directories of the path, yielding \fB/Users/foo/Development/chaos/website\fR\.
