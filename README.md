## Problem 1
     
The problem is: `$$\frac34 + \frac56 = ?$$`
     
To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. A common denominator is a number that both denominators can divide into evenly. One way to find a common denominator is to multiply the two denominators together. In this case, we get `$$4 \times 6 = 24$$`. So, we can use 24 as our common denominator.
     
Next, we need to rewrite the fractions with the common denominator. To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the same number that will make the denominator equal to 24. For example, to rewrite `$$\frac34$$` with a denominator of 24, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 6, since `$$4 \times 6 = 24$$`. We get `$$\frac3 \times 64 \times 6 = \frac1824$$`. Similarly, to rewrite `$$\frac56$$` with a denominator of 24, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4, since `$$6 \times 4 = 24$$`. We get `$$\frac5 \times 46 \times 4 = \frac2024$$`.

Now that we have rewritten the fractions with the same denominator, we can add them by adding their numerators and keeping the same denominator. We get `$$\frac1824 + \frac2024 = \frac18 + 2024 = \frac3824$$`.
     
The final step is to simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 38 and 24 is 2, since 2 is the largest number that can divide into both numbers evenly. We get `$$\frac3824 \div \frac22 = \frac38 \div 224 \div 2 = \frac1912$$`.
     
Therefore, the answer is `$$\frac1912$$`.
     
## Problem 2
     
The problem is: `$$(x + 3)(x - 5) = ?$$`
     
To solve this problem, we need to use the distributive property of multiplication. The distributive property states that `$$(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$$`. In other words, we multiply each term in the first parentheses by each term in the second parentheses and add them together.
     
In this case, we have `$$(x + 3)(x - 5) = x(x - 5) + 3(x - 5)$$`. Next, we simplify each term by multiplying them out. We get `$$x(x - 5) + 3(x - 5) = x^2 - 5x + 3x - 15$$`. Then, we combine like terms by adding or subtracting them. Like terms are terms that have the same variable and exponent. We get `$$x^2 - 5x + 3x - 15 = x^2 - 2x - 15$$`.
     
Therefore, the answer is `$$x^2 - 2x - 15$$`.
